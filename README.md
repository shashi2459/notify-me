# notify-me
   
   This app will let you know who is calling you without looking at phone, just by hearing calling person's name.
   isn't that cool?
  
   If you have connected your headsets to phone and your phone started ringing, then you will hear a calling persons's name (if the person is in your contact).
   
   Then a mic of your headset will start to take an input whether you want to answer or ignore this call.
   
   After giving input as ANSWER or IGNORE, the respective action will be taken.
   This will happen without physically touching the phone :D.
   
   The main purpose of this app is to avoid unwanted calls or attending priority or important calls while you are driving.
   
   Of cource this app serves my needs and it may or may not feet in your case.
