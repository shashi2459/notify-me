# notify-me
   
   This app will let you know who is calling without looking at phone, just by hearing calling person's name.
   isn't that cool?
  
   If you have connected your headsets to phone and your phone rings, then you will hear a calling persons's name (if the number is present in your contact).
   
   Then a mic of your headset will start taking an input stating that whether you want to answer or ignore this call.
   
   After giving input as ANSWER or IGNORE, the respective action will be taken.
   This will happen without physically touching the phone :D.
   
   The main purpose of this app is to avoid unwanted calls or attending priority or important calls while you are driving.
   
   This app serves my needs and it may or may not feet in your case.
